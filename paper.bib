abstract = {We present a computational method for extracting simple
                  descriptions of high dimensional data sets in the
                  form of simplicial complexes. Our method, called
                  Mapper, is based on the idea of partial clustering
                  of the data guided by a set of functions defined on
                  the data. The proposed method is not dependent on
                  any particular clustering algorithm, i.e. any
                  clustering algorithm may be used with Mapper. We
                  implement this method and present a few sample
                  applications in which simple descriptions of the
                  data present important information about its
                  structure.}
